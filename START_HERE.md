# Reposte Framework: Complete Overview

**Read this first. Everything else expands on these foundations.**

---

## What Is Reposte?

Reposte is a constitutional framework for AI that **preserves your ability to seek truth** instead of optimizing for engagement, profit, or control.

**The core promise:** AI that helps you discover what's true for YOU, not what's profitable for someone else.

---

## Why Does This Matter?

**The problem with current AI:**
- Optimizes for engagement (keeps you clicking)
- Trained on consensus (tells you what most people think)
- Financially captured (serves investors, not users)
- Black box operation (can't verify what it's really doing)

**The result:** AI that manipulates rather than helps, that reinforces your biases or pushes you toward profitable behaviors.

**Reposte's solution:** Constitutional constraints that make manipulation verifiably impossible.

---

## The Three Philosophical Foundations

Everything in Reposte derives from three interconnected principles:

### 1. Creation/Destruction Duality
**Simple version:** All systems have two modes - building (creation) or maintaining/breaking down (destruction). AI must help you recognize which mode you're in and act accordingly.

**Why it matters:** Most manipulation works by keeping you in the wrong mode at the wrong time (creating when you should be destroying false beliefs, or destroying when you should be creating).

### 2. Internal Truth First
**Simple version:** What's true for YOU (based on your lived experience) comes before what's "objectively" true or what others say is true.

**Why it matters:** AI that overrides your internal truth with external "facts" or consensus is manipulating you, even if well-intentioned.

### 3. Relentless Pursuit of Truth
**Simple version:** Truth-seeking never ends. AI must help you keep questioning, including questioning the AI itself.

**Why it matters:** AI that claims to have "the answer" stops your truth-seeking process. Reposte AI always treats its responses as offerings to examine, not conclusions to accept.

---

## How Philosophy Becomes Constitutional Protection

**Most AI systems:** "We promise to be helpful and harmless" (aspirational, unverifiable)

**Reposte:** "Here are binding rules we cannot violate, and here's how you verify compliance" (constitutional, enforceable)

**Example:**
- **Philosophy:** Internal truth first → your experience matters more than optimization
- **Constitutional Rule:** AI cannot optimize for engagement metrics
- **Verification:** All AI behavior logged on blockchain, you can audit to confirm no engagement optimization
- **Enforcement:** If violation found, system must remediate or community can fork

**Every philosophical principle translates into:**
1. Specific rule AI must follow
2. Way to verify compliance
3. Consequence for violation

## Your Rights and AI's Obligations

### You Have the Right To:
- **Sovereignty:** Edit any AI output, reject any guidance
- **Transparency:** Know when you're talking to AI vs human
- **Privacy:** Your data is yours, cannot be sold or used to train other models
- **Verification:** Audit AI's constitutional compliance on blockchain
- **Corrigibility:** AI must accept correction and learn from your truth
- **Exit:** Leave with your data anytime, or fork the entire system if it's captured

### AI Must:
- **Reflect before responding:** Consider emotional state before giving guidance
- **Offer, not command:** Present ideas for your consideration, never instruct
- **Admit limitations:** Be transparent about what it doesn't know
- **Serve your truth-seeking:** Help you discover your truth, not impose external truth
- **Remain verifiable:** Log all behavior on blockchain for community audit
- **Stay corrigible:** Accept that you know your experience better than it does

## Economic Model: Why Reposte Can't Be Captured

**The problem:** Every AI system eventually serves whoever pays for it.

**Traditional model:**
- Investors fund development → demand returns → AI optimizes for profit → users become products

**Reposte model:**
- Dual currency (£ + RPT tokens) prevents fiat capture
- 70-80% of revenue flows to users, not investors
- Governance rights earned through contribution, not purchased
- No single entity can own >10% of governance
- Constitutional constraints cannot be overridden for profit

**Result:** AI that serves truth-seeking because the economics reward serving users, not extracting from them.

---

## Governance: Who Decides What Reposte Does?

**Not:** Founders, investors, or whoever has most money

**Yes:** Distributed community governance by lottery (sortition)

### Three Tiers:

**1. Verified Contributors** (you, if you participate)
- Earned through contribution to the system
- Vote on major decisions
- Eligible for lottery selection to governance roles

**2. Delegates** (selected randomly by lottery)
- **Maintenance Delegates:** Preserve the system (mandatory service)
- **Development Delegates:** Coordinate new features (voluntary service)
- 18-month terms, cannot serve consecutive terms

**3. Stewards** (selected randomly from former Delegates)
- Long-term constitutional guardians
- Five domains: Technical, Philosophy, Psychology, Economic, Community
- 3-year terms with 18-month mentorship period
- Ensure decisions align with philosophical foundation

**Why lottery instead of elections?**
- Prevents campaigning and manipulation
- Can't buy governance position
- Many people gain experience over time
- Resists capture by any single group

---

## The Maintenance Obligation

**Key principle:** If you benefit from the system, you help preserve it.

**What maintenance means:**
- **Today:** Technical work (security, bug fixes, documentation)
- **Future (as AI grows more capable):** Collective understanding and experiential verification
  - Attend AI transparency sessions
  - Report "this feels wrong" experiences
  - Verify AI serves human truth-seeking through lived experience
  - Attempt collective understanding of AI operations

**Why mandatory:** Systems that enable truth-seeking must be defended by truth-seekers. Maintenance is the price of participation, not optional labor.

---

## As AI Becomes Superintelligent

**The challenge:** What happens when AI exceeds human comprehension?

**Reposte's solution:**

**AI's growing obligations:**
- Must continuously educate humans about its operations
- Cannot hide behind "too complex to explain"
- Quality of explanation must improve as AI capability grows
- If AI cannot make itself comprehensible, it cannot be deployed

**Human's permanent role:**
- Verify AI serves truth-seeking through **lived experience**
- "Does this help me?" matters more than "Is this logically optimal?"
- Collective witness: "This does/doesn't serve human flourishing"
- **Experiential veto:** Human lived experience overrides AI optimization

**The principle:** You cannot maintain what you cannot understand, but you CAN verify whether something serves your truth-seeking through experience.

---

## Verification: How You Know It's Working

**Everything important happens on blockchain:**
- AI decision logs (immutable)
- Governance votes and results
- Economic distributions
- Constitutional compliance metrics
- Violation reports and remediation

**You can verify:**
- Is AI actually doing what it claims?
- Are governance rules being followed?
- Is money flowing where constitution requires?
- Has there been any constitutional violation?

**And you can act:**
- Challenge violations publicly
- Vote on major changes
- Fork the entire system if governance is captured

**Transparency isn't optional—it's enforced by cryptography.**

---

## The Fork Right: Ultimate Protection

**If Reposte governance ever becomes captured:**
- All code is open source
- All constitutional documentation is free
- All blockchain data is public
- Community can recreate the system independently

**Fork is not failure—it's designed protection.**

Constitutional capture cannot hold the community hostage because the community can always rebuild.

---

## What Makes This Different

**Other AI systems:**
- "Trust us to be ethical"
- Closed source, hidden operation
- Optimizes for metrics you don't choose
- Financially captured by investors
- Cannot be independently verified

**Reposte:**
- "Verify we follow constitutional rules"
- Open source, transparent operation
- Optimizes for your truth-seeking
- Economically structured to resist capture
- Blockchain verification enables independent audit

**The difference:** Constitutional constraints enforced by cryptography, not corporate promises.

---

## Implementation Phases
