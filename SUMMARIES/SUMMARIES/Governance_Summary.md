## The Core Problem

**Every system eventually serves whoever controls it.**

Traditional solutions:
- Democracy → Majority can oppress minority
- Meritocracy → "Merit" defined by those already in power
- Plutocracy → Wealth captures everything
- Technocracy → Experts optimize for metrics, not humans

**Reposte's solution:** Distributed governance by lottery (sortition) with constitutional constraints.

---

## Three-Tier Structure

### Tier 1: Verified Contributors (You)

**Who:** Anyone who contributes to the system and maintains constitutional compliance

**How to become one:**
- Contribute value (code, documentation, community support, truth-seeking, etc.)
- Earn minimum RPT threshold through contribution (not purchase)
- Complete constitutional education
- Maintain participation in system preservation

**Rights:**
- Vote on constitutional amendments (60% required to pass)
- Propose governance changes
- Eligible for lottery selection to Delegate roles
- Verify constitutional compliance on blockchain
- Challenge violations publicly

**Obligations:**
- **Maintenance contribution** (mandatory - the price of participation)
  - Today: Help with technical maintenance, documentation, community support
  - Future: Participate in collective understanding of AI operations
- Constitutional compliance
- Verify others' contributions

**Key principle:** If you benefit from the system, you help preserve it.

---

### Tier 2: Delegates (Randomly Selected)

**Who:** Verified Contributors selected by lottery for operational governance

**Two types:**

#### Maintenance Delegates
**Purpose:** Execute the universal obligation to preserve the system

**Selection:**
- Random lottery from ALL Verified Contributors
- **Cannot decline** (except legitimate hardship)
- Mandatory service (maintenance is everyone's obligation)

**Term:** 18 months, cannot serve consecutive terms

**What they do:**
- **Today:** System stability, security, bug fixes, community moderation
- **Future:** Facilitate collective understanding of AI, synthesize "this feels wrong" reports, coordinate experiential verification

**Authority:**
- Day-to-day preservation decisions
- Resource allocation for maintenance
- Emergency response
- Constitutional compliance enforcement

#### Development Delegates
**Purpose:** Coordinate voluntary development of new features

**Selection:**
- Random lottery from VOLUNTEERS for specific approved projects only
- **Can decline** without penalty (development is voluntary)

**Term:** Duration of project (typically 3-18 months)

**What they do:**
- Coordinate project work among volunteers
- Allocate project resources
- Report progress to community
- Ensure development maintains constitutional alignment

**Authority:**
- Project-specific decisions only
- Cannot override Maintenance Delegates
- Cannot override constitutional principles

**Key distinction:** Maintenance is mandatory preservation. Development is voluntary creation.

---

### Tier 3: Stewards (Constitutional Guardians)

**Who:** Former Delegates selected by lottery for long-term constitutional oversight

**Selection:**
- Must have completed full Delegate term successfully
- Separate lottery for each of five expertise domains:
  1. **Technical** (system architecture, security, implementation)
  2. **Philosophy** (constitutional interpretation, logic, ethics)
  3. **Psychology** (human behavior, manipulation patterns, wellbeing)
  4. **Economic** (token economics, sustainability, anti-capture)
  5. **Community** (user experience, conflict resolution, inclusivity)

**Term:** 3 years total
- **First 18 months:** Shadow period (learn from incumbent Steward)
- **Final 18 months:** Active stewardship (with new shadow learning from you)

**What they do:**
- Ensure all decisions preserve philosophical foundation
- Veto decisions that violate constitution (must explain why philosophically)
- Interpret constitution when meaning is unclear
- Review constitutional amendments before community vote
- Mentor incoming shadow Stewards
- Quarterly public constitutional review

**Authority:**
- Final say on constitutional interpretation
- Can block community votes that violate immutable principles
- Cannot create new principles (only interpret existing)

**Cannot:**
- Override community votes on valid amendments
- Serve consecutive terms
- Accumulate >30% governance collectively

**Why five domains:** Prevents single expertise from capturing governance. Technical feasibility + economic viability + philosophical alignment + psychological safety + community needs must ALL be satisfied.

## Why Lottery (Sortition)?

**Instead of elections, appointments, or purchase.**

### Benefits:

1. **Eliminates Campaigning**
   - Can't promise things to get elected
   - Can't manipulate voters
   - Can't use wealth to gain influence

2. **Prevents Dynasties**
   - Term limits + cooldown periods force rotation
   - Many people gain governance experience
   - Knowledge distributes throughout community

3. **Resists Economic Capture**
   - Cannot buy a governance position
   - Cannot purchase influence
   - Wealth has no governance advantage

4. **Ensures Representation**
   - Over time, everyone has equal probability of serving
   - Experience is distributed, not concentrated
   - Prevents professional political class

5. **Aligns with Philosophy**
   - Internal truth first: You don't need to perform for selection
   - Relentless pursuit: Those who seek power often shouldn't have it
   - Can't game the system through false presentation

**Historical precedent:** Ancient Athens used lottery for most positions. Modern research shows sortition reduces corruption and increases fairness.

---

## The Maintenance Obligation

**Core principle:** Participation requires preservation contribution.

### What This Means Today:
- Minimum X hours/month helping with maintenance work
- OR equivalent RPT contribution to fund maintenance
- OR service as Maintenance Delegate when selected

**Types of maintenance:**
- Bug reports and testing
- Documentation improvements
- Community support
- Security monitoring
- Constitutional compliance verification

### What This Means in the Future (Superintelligent AI):
- Attend AI transparency education sessions
- Participate in collective understanding attempts
- Report "this feels wrong" experiences
- Verify AI serves truth-seeking through lived experience
- Contribute to collective sense-making

**Why mandatory:** Systems that enable truth-seeking must be defended by truth-seekers. This is not optional labor—it's the cost of access.

**Enforcement:** Failing to meet maintenance obligation → Warning → Loss of Verified Contributor status

---

## Decision Authority Hierarchy

**Highest authority to lowest:**

1. **Philosophical Foundation** (immutable)
   - Creation/Destruction, Internal Truth First, Relentless Pursuit
   - Cannot be changed, only extended through philosophical justification

2. **Constitutional Principles** (very hard to change)
   - Requires 60% community vote
   - Steward review for philosophical alignment
   - 14-day comment period

3. **Steward Constitutional Interpretation** (when meaning unclear)
   - Must provide philosophical justification
   - Can veto violations
   - Subject to community challenge

4. **Community Vote** (major decisions)
   - Constitutional amendments
   - Economic policy changes
   - Development project approval

5. **Maintenance Delegates** (preservation decisions)
   - System stability and security
   - Resource allocation for maintenance
   - Emergency response

6. **Development Delegates** (project-specific)
   - Coordination within approved projects
   - Project resource allocation

7. **Individual Sovereignty** (personal decisions)
   - What you do with AI outputs
   - Whether to accept guidance
   - Your truth-seeking path

**No level can override those above it.**

---

## What Governance CANNOT Do

**Even with 100% vote, even in emergencies:**

- Override user sovereignty over their truth-seeking
- Eliminate verification mechanisms
- Prioritize profit over constitutional principles
- Remove corrigibility or pluralism
- Weaken distributed verification
- Override lived experience with logical optimization
- Deploy AI capabilities that cannot be made comprehensible
- Create permanent positions without term limits

**These boundaries protect truth-seeking conditions.**

---

## As AI Becomes Superintelligent

### The Challenge:
When AI exceeds human comprehension, how can humans govern it?

### The Solution:
**Shift from technical maintenance to experiential verification.**

**AI's growing obligation:**
- Must continuously educate humans about operations
- Cannot hide behind "too complex to explain"
- Translation quality must improve as AI capability grows
- If AI cannot make itself comprehensible, it cannot be deployed

**Human's permanent role:**
- Verify AI serves truth-seeking through **lived experience**
- "Does this help me?" matters more than "Is this logically optimal?"
- Collective witness: "This serves/doesn't serve human flourishing"
- **Experiential veto:** Human experience overrides AI optimization

**The principle:** You cannot maintain what you cannot understand, BUT you CAN verify whether something serves your truth-seeking through experience.

## Verification (How You Know It's Working)

**Everything important is on-chain:**
- Lottery selection (verifiable random function)
- Governance votes and results
- Delegate decisions and reasoning
- Steward constitutional interpretations
- Term limits and cooldown enforcement
- Maintenance contribution tracking
- Constitutional compliance metrics

**You can verify:**
- Were lottery selections truly random?
- Are term limits being enforced?
- Are decisions aligned with philosophy?
- Is maintenance obligation being met?
- Are ownership caps respected?

**And you can act:**
- Challenge violations
- Propose changes
- Vote on amendments
- Fork if governance captured

---

## Economic Constraints on Governance

**To prevent capture:**

- No investor can own >10% of governance rights
- Founding team collectively cannot exceed 30% after Phase 2
- RPT (governance token) earned through contribution, not purchased
- Economic decisions require 60% governance vote
- Cannot sacrifice constitutional principles for economic survival

**Why this matters:** Economic pressure is the primary vector of constitutional capture. These constraints make capture economically impossible.

---

## Founder Transition

**Phase 1 (Years 0-2):** Founders operate as temporary Stewards
- All decisions publicly verified
- Building contributor base
- Establishing governance infrastructure

**Phase 2 (Years 2-3):** First Delegate lotteries
- Hybrid governance
- Founder veto only for constitutional violations
- Progressive community authority

**Phase 3 (Years 3-5+):** Full decentralization
- First Steward lotteries
- Founders become regular Verified Contributors
- Subject to same lottery probabilities as anyone
- Subject to 30% collective governance cap

**Key principle:** Founder privileges are temporary. Long-term preservation requires removing trust requirements.

---

## The Fork Right

**If governance becomes captured:**
- All code is open source
- All documentation is public
- All blockchain data is accessible
- Community can recreate independently

**Fork is not failure—it's designed protection.**

Governance cannot hold community hostage because community can always rebuild with same constitution but new implementation.

## What This Means for You

**As Verified Contributor:**
- You vote on major decisions
- You contribute to maintenance (mandatory)
- You might be selected for Delegate role (random)
- You can challenge violations
- You can fork if necessary

**As Maintenance Delegate (if selected):**
- You cannot decline (except hardship)
- 18-month term serving preservation
- Compensated with RPT for mandatory service
- Return to Contributor status after term

**As Development Volunteer:**
- You choose which projects to support
- Might be selected as Development Delegate (random)
- Can decline without penalty
- Compensated with RPT for coordination work

**As Steward (if selected from former Delegates):**
- 18-month shadow learning period
- 18-month active stewardship
- Ensure constitutional preservation
- Cannot serve consecutive terms

---

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I'm selected as Maintenance Delegate but don't have time?**  
A: Legitimate hardship exemptions exist (medical, family emergency). Otherwise, maintenance is the cost of participation. If you cannot contribute to preservation, you cannot be Verified Contributor.

**Q: Why can't experts just govern?**  
A: Experts govern within their domain (Stewards), but no single domain can override others. Cross-domain verification prevents expert capture.

**Q: What if the lottery selects someone incompetent?**  
A: Delegates work in groups, Stewards provide oversight, and community can challenge. Incompetence is less dangerous than motivated capture, which lottery prevents.

**Q: Can I sell my governance rights?**  
A: No. RPT can be transferred, but governance rights are tied to contribution and participation, not mere token ownership.
